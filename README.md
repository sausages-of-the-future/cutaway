Simple window into where clients are in journey

Basically a [rip off of](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-websockets).

If you development-environment is up to date (app config wise, all puppet modules installed) this app will just run with the standard dev-start-all.

However you need to visit it at:

```
http://172.16.42.43:8007/
```

As I have not created a specific websocket compatible nginx config for this app yet.
